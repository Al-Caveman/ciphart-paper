hi --- i propose \emph{ciphart}, a sequential memory-hard key derivation
function that has a security gain that's measurable more objectively and
more conveniently than anything in class known to date.

to nail this goal, \emph{ciphart}'s security gain is measured in the unit
of \emph{relative entropy bits}.  relative to what?  relative to the
encryption algorithm that's used later on.  therefore, this \emph{relative
entropy bits} measure is guaranteed to be true when the encryption
algorithm that's used with \emph{ciphart} is also the same one that's used
to encrypt the data afterwards.
